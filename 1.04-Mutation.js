// Recall that in functional programming, changing or altering things is called mutation,
// and the outcome is called a side effect.

// Practice
// Fill in the code for the function incrementer so it returns the value of the global
// variable fixedValue increased by one.

var fixedValue = 4;

var incrementer = () => {
  // Only change code below this line
  return fixedValue+1
  // Only change code above this line
}
